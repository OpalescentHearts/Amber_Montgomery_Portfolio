          For the seventh unit, we learned Java and SQL. As part of the unit project, my group decided to create a historical weapons database.

The historical weapons database is designed to provide users with information on various types of weapons from different historical periods. The database is divided into two categories: melee weapons and ranged weapons. Users can browse the weapons by category and view detailed information about each weapon, such as its name, description, and price.
